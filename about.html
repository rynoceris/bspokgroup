						<h5>“Bespoke” Origin and Definition</h5>

						<p>The word "bespoke" itself is derived from the verb: "to bespeak," to "stand for something" or, in a specialized meaning:   "to give order for it to be made" as to better reflect you.  Often, "bespoke" can often be identified as a British term for tailored clothing like a made-to-measure shirt or suit; custom configured software could also be recognized as "bespoke."  Early and mid-twentieth century tailors, shoemakers and automobile manufacturers were producing both "standard" and a highly personalized "bespoke" product line for those clients who sought even more individuality.</p>


						<h5>The <img class="bspok-sub" src="img/bspok-h5.png" alt=""/> Logo Explained</h5>
						<a href="/"><img class="logo" src="img/powered-by-bspok-group.png"/></a>

						<p>This somewhat obscure word here in the states, "bespoke" has been redefined with a modern day twist as “<img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy2.png" alt=""/>.”   Challenging industry norms, our creative expression begins as we intentionally first dropped the letter “e’s” from the traditional word.  This insightful and verbal expression was also our own way of setting new state-side house rules that our “<img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy2.png" alt=""/>” means group and not just one.  Think this simple rhyme:  No “e’s” not about me!   This similar spelling clearly reveals our understanding and overall awareness of the original word.   [Need a sentence to explain long “o” vowel symbol—do we go so far as to use the Wikipedia name that its called?].  Finally, a simple and subtle visual expression identifying a singular thumb print signifies our uniqueness but once together a group is formed.  At first, to keep it really simple, just have your group think:   “<img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy2.png" alt=""/> = custom”.</p>

						<h5>What Does <img class="bspok-sub" src="img/bspok-h5.png" alt=""/> Do?</h5>

						<h5>'<img class="bspok-sub" src="img/bspok-h5.png" alt=""/>' Today as We See It — 2011</h5>

						<p>Fast forward to 2012 — yes, Indy hosted a SuperBowl, the British still love their "bespoke" tailors, furniture, country houses and fine “bespoke” cars like Rolls Royce and Bentley; but, even here in the USA we see American's, Midwesterner’s and Hoosiers appreciate, enjoy and expect this whole “bespoke” thing too. At <img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy.png" alt=""/> we didn't need to travel over the pond to see this trend exists right here in central-Indiana... At any area Starbuck's you can have the barista make it your way rather than simply ordering off the menu; have it "your way" at Burger King; a new “Sherwin Williams Colors” app allows Smartphone users to match real world colors to a custom mixed paint.</p>

						<p>Amongst Jeep enthusiasts, increased demand by those who desire to make a truly personalized statement brought about the new Mojave. Recently BMW's website had a rotating headline: "Hundreds of millions of Possibilities:  How will you order your BMW?"   Even, Nike has an on-line “bespoke” collection allowing one to essentially build their very own shoe complete with name and team jersey number on the side.  Any high school, college student or parent sitting around can leisurely perform a quick Internet search for "custom made," "personalized," or "individual" followed by a noun like books, candy, gloves, socks, gym shoes and jelly beans and get hundreds of choices.</p>

						<p>Today's increasingly individualistic consumer places considerable value on self-expression. Asserting their individual identity through “bespoke” product has been rediscovered these past several years by manufacturers and mass marketers alike.  The marketplace phenomena of consumers shifting and exerting their power, control and demand as more and more genuinely expect these “bespoke” choices isn’t going away anytime soon.   More than ever, consumers seek products that make them stand out from the crowd and provide them with a sense of personal social identity and belonging.</p>
