							<h3>T-SHIRT BRANDS</h3>
							<p>Some of the basic t-shirt brands come from Gildan, Hanes or Anvil and are made from 100% cotton or blends like 50%-50%.  Weights typically vary from 5.4 ounces to 6.1 ounces in weight.  More recently pre-washed softer combed cotton t-shirts have become popular.  Softwr and stronger many of these are less in weight [say 4.5 ounces] than the basic counterparts.  In the last several years brands like American Apparel now offer premium t-shirts which are ring spun combed cotton and offer and even softer feel and more fitting look.  Some companies like Alternative Apparel takes the manufacturing process a step further, adding an enzyme wash on their fabric making the fabric feel "vintage soft" with very little shrinkage.  When needed, or budgets require Delta and Tultex offer less expensive entry level t-shirt styles.  Because these lack the same finishing, special washing, or use of lesser grade cotton and milling these shirts are always less expensive.</p>


							<h3>FABRICS</h3>
							<p>T-shirts vary greatly in price, depending on fabric choice and the overall manufacturing process. Most t-shirts are made of cotton. Cotton is a natural fiber that grows in the seedpod of the cotton plant.  If you even care, fibers are typically 1/2 inch to 2 inches long.  The longest staple fibers, longer than 1-1/2 inch (including the Pima and Egyptian varieties) produce the highest quality cotton fabrics.  Combed Cotton is a cotton yarn that goes through an additional combing process so that only the longer fibers remain. This improves the softness and strength of the yarn. Combed cotton tees cost more than cotton shirts that do not go through the combing process. With Ring Spun cotton, cotton fibers are tightly twisted together to make a stronger, smoother and finer thread. Ring spun cotton has a softer and finer feel than basic cotton fabric.</p>


							<h3>T-SHIRT SIZING</h3>
							<p>Basic tees are traditional in cut, taking on a boxier and bulkier fit.  Basic tees are unisex and run in Youth and Adult sizing. Fashion tees have a "junior" cut, running smaller than your average basic shirt. Available for men and women, these tees are form-fitting: tight and narrow down the torso to accentuate the natural curves of your body.</p>
