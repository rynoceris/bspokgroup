							<h3>The Effectiveness of Promotional Items</h3>
							<p>Promotional products are items that display a company name, logo, and/or contact information. These items are distributed to prospective and existing customers and are staples for most companies doing business today in the United States.</p>
							<p>Unlike traditional business marketing materials, such as a brochure or print advertisement, promotional products are designed with the idea that the customer will retain the item putting the product to good use, while being continually reminded of the business whose branding adorns the product.</p>
							<p>Businesses of all types and sizes are finding through trial and success with promotional products, that growth can be directly attributed to the use of such products in combination with creative advertising.</p>
							<p>Research has continually shown that promotional products can generate significant consumer traffic to a business establishment, with as many as 89 percent of respondents in one recent survey conducted, who were able to recall specific names of companies imprinted on the promotional items.</p>
							<p>There are several marketing advantages to creating and giving away promotional items, which include increased response rates and an improvement in business returns.</p>
							<p>While results for every company will vary compared to other conventional and costly advertising and marketing methods, promotional products are easy to obtain, affordable, and have an increased market reach and staying power.</p>

							<h3>Research</h3> 
							<p>In late 2009, the Promotional Products Association International (PPAI) designed a two-part study intended to evaluate a cross-section of the American consumer population about television, print, online and promotional products.</p>
							<p>The study, fielded through independent research company MarketTools, Inc., surveyed more than 1,000 respondents who recalled receiving a promotional product in the past 24 months.</p>
							<p>The first part of the study focused on promotional products and evaluated the action, reaction, and relationship of products and their recipients.</p>
							<p>The study concluded the following about the survey respondents:</p>
							<ul class="product-research">
							<li>94% could successfully recall a promotional product they had received in the past two years</li>
							<li>89% could recall the advertiser of the promotional product.</li>
							<li>83% reported that they liked receiving promotional products</li>
							<li>48% would like to receive promotional products more often</li>
							<li>69% typically keep the promotional product</li>
							</ul>

							<p>The second part of the PPAI study focused on comparing promotional products to mainstream media (television, print and online advertising) and evaluating their reach, consumer recall, and reaction to each.</p>
							<p>The findings of the second part of the study include the following:</p>
							<ul class="product-research">
							<li>Promotional products were the only media that showed staggering results in recall and reaction.</li>
							<li>Compared to TV, print and online advertising, promotional products delivered higher recall rates of the company/brand</li>
							<li>Consumers made a purchase after receiving a promotional product (20.9%) more often than after viewing a print ad (13.4%), TV commercial (7.1%), or online (4.6%).</li>
							</ul>

							<p>With organized access to hundreds of thousands unique items we can find or source just about anything—really!  If we can’t source it domestically--we can go globally.  We know how to listen to our clients, help define their marketing goals and objectives to design an effective promotional campaign.  We value your marketing objectives and seek to find unique items representative of your culture, team, group or company!  We know the power of promotional products and their ability to draw and attract new customers as well as retain current ones.</p>
							<p>Sometimes we sense there can be a negative association to promotional product as nothing more than “trinkets.”   It’s also important to understand your budget so that we can deliver high quality items with a focus value! Working together we’ll set aggressive high expectations and clearly understand your marketing objectives, goals and expectations.  Once done, we’ll deliver ideas yielding a current and contemporary prized piece of promotional merchandise that is kept and valued by you and your client, team or audience.</p>
							   
							<h3>Increasing Brand Awareness</h3>
							<p>In previous years, companies spent a considerable amount of time and money on promotional items that were merely effective enough to get their names out. (Simply print a logo on a product without any thought.)  More recently, the trend has changed in that a majority of companies are now spending their money on promotional products that both align with their company’s creative direction and marketing goals and focus on increasing brand awareness.  By doing this, a company can justify spending a significant amount on promotional items because of the high rate of success attributed with promotional products used to create and increase brand awareness.</p>
							<p>Without thinking the promotional product purchase for a specific business through, that business runs the risk of not having the promotional item work to the company’s utmost advantage. Many companies will randomly choose products and put their brand on them, but it takes more than that to increase brand awareness with promotional products.</p>

							<p>In order to achieve success for a business, a promotional product should be:</p>
							<ol class="brand-awareness">
							<li>A product that customers/clients will find great use for– something that they will discard away upon receipt.</li>
							<li>Aligning the product with the customer’s needs is highly important.</li>
							<li>Suitably aligned to the company’s products and services.</li>
							<li>Constructed/developed in a way that best highlights the company brand.</li>
							<li>Positively reflective of the company’s image/brand in terms of quality.</li>
							<li>If a company wants its clients to associate its brand with quality products, do not choose a cheap, low-end promotional product.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Growing a Business</h3>
							<p>People are more likely to remember a business if they have a more personal, gratifying experience with the business. If a company puts an ad on TV, it is likely that the viewer will remember the company’s name when they see the ad, but this all depends on the amount of television that he/she watches, as well as how often the commercial is played, among other factors. If a company spends that same money on promotional products, it is highly likely that people will remember the company every time they use the promotional products that were given.</p>
							<p>Branding is crucial for all businesses. People see logos of large corporations like Target and Coca-Cola, and they immediately know what it is. Each company should strive for that kind of recognition, and promotional products are an affordable and effective method.</p>
							<p>Provided that the company is customer-oriented and dedicated to service and success, the brand will build itself simply because people will trust that it is the best. They will keep coming back when they see and use the promotional products and remember that the company is there and ready to serve.</p>
							<p>The bottom line is this: people cannot come to a business if they don’t know that it exists or what it does. Promotional products can tell them exactly that, as well as allow them to have a constant reminder of how the company can help them in their daily lives.</p>
							
							<h3>Summary</h3> 
							<p>Promotional products are a highly cost effective way for companies in which to engage existing and potential customers.</p>
							<p>With a successful track record backed by research studies that indicate an average of 89 percent of respondents could recall the company name of the promotional product they received, it is a surefire win for companies to spend money on the promotional products, and see a substantial return on that money.</p>
							<p>However, there are strategies involved for companies on selecting the right kind of promotional product, and those include aligning the company’s creative marketing and branding with the selected promotional products.</p>
							<p>By doing this, a company can justify spending a significant amount on promotional items because of the reaction it will generate from customers.</p>
							<p>The above strategies are especially important at tradeshows, which are a great platform for companies to create brand recognition and recall. At tradeshows there are dozens of other companies vying for the same business. If a company does not stand out with their offerings, which includes selecting relevant, quality, memorable promotional products, the likelihood of customer retention from a tradeshow is very low.</p>
							<p>Promotional products will continue to be one of the most effective, affordable, and creative ways for a company to both hold its ground in the competitive world we live in, as well as evolve as the world changes. As long as companies understand that there are strategies for choosing the right kind of promotional product in alignment with the company goals and branding initiatives, it is safe to assume that these companies will succeed in their endeavors to grow their business.</p>

							<h3>T-SHIRT BRANDS</h3>
							<p>Some of the basic t-shirt brands come from Gildan, Hanes or Anvil and are made from 100% cotton or blends like 50%-50%.  Weights typically vary from 5.4 ounces to 6.1 ounces in weight.  More recently pre-washed softer combed cotton t-shirts have become popular.  Softwr and stronger many of these are less in weight [say 4.5 ounces] than the basic counterparts.  In the last several years brands like American Apparel now offer premium t-shirts which are ring spun combed cotton and offer and even softer feel and more fitting look.  Some companies like Alternative Apparel takes the manufacturing process a step further, adding an enzyme wash on their fabric making the fabric feel "vintage soft" with very little shrinkage.  When needed, or budgets require Delta and Tultex offer less expensive entry level t-shirt styles.  Because these lack the same finishing, special washing, or use of lesser grade cotton and milling these shirts are always less expensive.</p>


							<h3>FABRICS</h3>
							<p>T-shirts vary greatly in price, depending on fabric choice and the overall manufacturing process. Most t-shirts are made of cotton. Cotton is a natural fiber that grows in the seedpod of the cotton plant.  If you even care, fibers are typically 1/2 inch to 2 inches long.  The longest staple fibers, longer than 1-1/2 inch (including the Pima and Egyptian varieties) produce the highest quality cotton fabrics.  Combed Cotton is a cotton yarn that goes through an additional combing process so that only the longer fibers remain. This improves the softness and strength of the yarn. Combed cotton tees cost more than cotton shirts that do not go through the combing process. With Ring Spun cotton, cotton fibers are tightly twisted together to make a stronger, smoother and finer thread. Ring spun cotton has a softer and finer feel than basic cotton fabric.</p>


							<h3>T-SHIRT SIZING</h3>
							<p>Basic tees are traditional in cut, taking on a boxier and bulkier fit.  Basic tees are unisex and run in Youth and Adult sizing. Fashion tees have a "junior" cut, running smaller than your average basic shirt. Available for men and women, these tees are form-fitting: tight and narrow down the torso to accentuate the natural curves of your body.</p>
