					<p><img class="border dtg-img" src="img/anajet-dtg.png" width="379" alt="Anajet Dtg" align="left" />Direct to Garment [DTG] printing is a new state of the art technology to the screen-printing industry that has grown in popularity and preference within the past ten years. As of 2007, [DTG] printing was so new that 99% of printing was traditional and 1% [DTG] on textiles! Direct to garment [DTG] is the process of printing directly onto apparel using specialized inkjet printers engineered specifically for applications on textiles.  The better [DTG] printers provide a clean, easy and convenient way to decorate garments replacing conventional screen-printing and dye sublimation methods.</p>
					<p>In the last five years, as consumer choices have changed, the emphasis and focus on personalization has continued to increase annually, too. <img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy.png" alt=""/> recognizes customer's are also expecting greater control in design process that we want to support.  [DTG] printers have undergone a revolution as they have completely changed.  [DTG] manufacturers recognized the steady shift by consumers and listened to the printing professionals.  Over the past few years, companies like bspōk group made it clear to them the personalization, increased individuality, and expression trend showed no sign any time soon of changing or going away.</p>
					<p><img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy.png" alt=""/> recently invested in the industry’s fastest DTG printer the Anajet ® MP-10.  This [DTG] is one of "the better" printers capable of producing a precise image rivaling a color photograph. Provided quality artwork is prepared, even the most complicated designs can be printed on a white t-shirt in under 20 seconds easily.  With great art prep, all the costly 4 color process set-up fees to achieve the same results that shops without direct to garment [DTG] capabilities must charge are eliminated and avoided!</p>

					<h3>ONLY ANAJET® MP-10 [DTG] printer in central-Indiana!</h3>

					<p>As a brand new machine with a steep capital investment - <img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy.png" alt=""/> currently operates the only MP-10 digital printer in metro-Indianapolis.  “Made in USA,” this [DTG] machine is eco-friendly and represents a leap-frog in technology and overall engineering.  This isn’t just a new model with a different part and cosmetic change here and there. Instead, every component and its functionality was engineered from the ground up.  Our [DTG] printer is also unique because of the patented bi-directional ink flow system eliminating any possibility of contamination in any of its six coated commercial ink heads.  This closed system also permits full control of ink saturation in one pass unlike any other [DTG] printer on the market.</p>

					<p>This is the fastest and most robust industrial level [DTG] machine in the marketplace.  Even more importantly, simplified maintenance allows for consistently better prints, cleaner ink heads and higher productivity.  AnaBright® Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black along with proprietary AnaWhite® are each water based inks that are environmentally friendly.</p>

					<h3>You’re probably thinking, “What’s the big deal and why does this benefit me?</h3>

					<p>With traditional screen-printing, budgets are often limited on the amount of colors you can have per design, even though some of the largest industrial shops may have the newest fourteen color automatic presses. This is due to costly set-up and screen charges when factored into small print runs to determine a final piece price.  If you have a very detailed logo with lots of colors [like a picture image] that you need printed, or low quantities, direct to garment [DTG] printing over traditional screen-printing may be the best way to go!</p>
					<h4>[DTG] print features:</h4>
					<ul id="dtg-features">
						<li>Super soft, no feel on white or light garments without underbase.</li>
						<li>Unlimited colors in design and final output</li>
						<li>NO setup fees with properly prepared Vector Art at 300 dpi</li>
						<li>Standard print area is 12” x 10” </li>
						<li>Can print up to 18” x 15” print area at an extra charge</li>
						<li>Prints on 50%-50% blends and 100% cotton garments</li>
						<li>Prints on light or dark garments [extra charge] </li>
						<li>Low 6 piece minimum for standard production! </li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Here are some helpful tips to get you started:</h4>
					<p>To get the very best digital print, quality artwork is one of the most important factors when considering direct to garment [DTG] printing. <img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy.png" alt=""/> welcome’s complex CMYK artwork for even those smaller six piece runs.  Afterall, that’s what the [DTG] printer is for! In the long run, if you really do only need a small run of shirts printed, then it will likely be far less expensive to have them printed digitally.</p>
					<h4>For [DTG] printing the best possible prints come from artwork prepared in the following manner:</h4>
					<ul id="anajet-guidelines">
						<li>CMYK PSD File 300 dpi.</li>
						<li>Along with a transparent background, all layers should be merged together as one. </li>
						<li>Artwork MUST also be sized to print before it is submitted, with all colors adjusted as you see fit. </li>
					</ul>

					<p>To avoid additional charges all these requirements must be fulfilled in order to proceed quickly and decisively to process your artwork.</p>
					<p><b><em>Remember:</em></b> Artwork preparation is the most vital step in ensuring that your final product is as vibrant and stunning as it can possibly be. If artwork is not to size, there is no transparent background, or any other requirements are not met, we will return your file to you for changes.  Or, if at that point you prefer: Our graphic design department can process your artwork, which does add additional art charges.</p>

					<p>If you are familiar with Adobe ® Photoshop, when considering digital photography <img class="bspok-copy" src="img/bspok-body-copy.png" alt=""/> also suggests use of the BRIGHTNESS / CONTRAST sliders to add greater contrast to your images. This will help to bring out the brightest possible colors in your prints.</p>
					<p>Other good tools are the FOREGROUND FILL (to replace duller areas of color with brighter shades of the same color), CURVES, COLOR BALANCE, and HUE / SATURATION. The goal is to make the image a little brighter than you actually want it to print (without washing out the color and detail, and ensuring you are in <b><em>CMYK</em></b> mode when you do it). This will ensure that the shirt comes out to your satisfaction the first time we print it.</p>
					<p>If you still have any specific questions about artwork prep for the <b>[DTG];</b> or, if you would like our graphic design department to process your files for you at additional costs, please contact us directly at: <a href="mailto:art@bspokgroup.com">art@bspokgroup.com</a> or use our <a href="/contact.php">contact form</a>.</p>
