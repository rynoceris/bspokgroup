					<p><img class="border laser-engraving-img" src="img/laser-engraving.png" width="379" alt="Laser Engraving" align="left" />Laser Engraving is the newest form of engraving which offers exceptional detail, and the type of finish in this category done most often by modern engravers.  The laser is more versatile, more accurate, faster and more economical than any other type of engraving; personalization’s are far easier to accomplish on the laser than nearly any other form of embellishment besides direct to garment [DTG]. We can even engrave photographs on many items using our lasers! Laser engraving offers lots of flexibility in reproducing artwork, small fonts and tight copy on most products.</p>
					
					<p>Laser Engraving is one of the best solutions for creating a permanent marking which does not detract from the appearance of the item. By varying both the speed and power of engraving, we are able to make engraving barely visible, but can also make it large and noticeable, if desired. Many different materials can be engraved or marked with a laser, including anodized aluminum. It is also possible to engrave materials such as plastic, wood, leather and glass. Engraving is useful for many purposes, from creating aesthetic designs on promotional products to very unique business cards and even custom Christmas ornaments! The possibilities are nearly endless!</p>
					
					<h3>How does laser engraving work?</h3>

					<p>Laser engraving is an abrasion-free, contact-free process that does not require any adjusting or clamping of the material to be engraved. Unlike traditional cutting machines, laser engravers don’t expose users to open, moving parts – making them as safe to use as a CD player or microwave oven.</p>

					<h3>LASER ENGRAVING-FAQ’s</h3>

					<h4>How is laser engraving different from standard engraving?</h4>
					
					<p>With the CO2 laser, nothing touches the product. This allows for greater precision since there is no risk of motion or movement.</p>

					<h4>Is laser engraving safe?</h4>
					
					<p>Absolutely, laser engraving is an abrasion-free, contact-free process that does not require any adjusting or clamping of the material to be engraved within the machine.  Laser engraving machines don’t expose the operator to open, moving parts – making it just as safe and efficient to use as a microwave oven or CD player.</p>

					<h4>Is laser engraving clean?</h4>
					
					<p>Yes, its clean edges and fine detail aren’t the only things that are "clean" about laser engraving.  The better machines have advanced exhaust and filtration system’s.</p>

					<h4>What are minimum and maximum item sizes you can laser engrave?</h4>
					
					<p><em>We have the capacity to engrave an item 29” wide x 17" long x 10" deep.</em></p>

					<h4>What is the difference between vector and raster graphic?</h4>

					<p>A vector graphic is made up of paths, or lines, that are either straight or curved. A raster graphic is an array of pixels which together form an image. Vector images can be scaled to be very large without losing quality, while raster graphics, on the other hand, become "blocky," since each pixel increases in size as the image is made larger.</p>

					<h4>What style of artwork is best?</h4>

					<p>This depends on your project, but generally speaking crisp, clean lines will read best. Designs with high contrast will be the most successful for engraving. Under our design services, we will gladly transfer raster files into vector and vice versa.</p>

					<h4>Does laser engraving apply color?</h4>

					<p>No, our CO2 laser does not apply color. In fact, it actually extracts color from dyed materials like denim and linen.</p>

					<h4>What do these materials look like after engraving?</h4>

					<p><b>Acrylic</b> can be be engraved very beautifully. It produces a sharp, clean and frosted image. Engraved images and texts can be color-filled. Engraving depth can be customized to your specifications.</p>

					<p><b>Corian</b> is a man-made material. When engraved, it produces sharp and clean image. Engraved images and texts can be color-filled. Engraving depth can be customized to your specifications. </p>

					<p><b>Woods/Natural Materials</b> - Directly "burning" images on wood is one of our specialties.  The laser power required here is often less than what it takes to cut through. Hardwoods like walnut, oak, mahogany and maple produce excellent results. Softwoods can be judiciously engraved; but, tend to vaporize at less-consistent depths.  Hard papers and fiberboard work well; linty papers and newsprint are like softwoods.  Finished leathers though can be laser-engraved with a look very similar to hot-branding.  Certain latex rubber compounds can be laser engraved; for example, these can be used to fabricate inking-stamps. When paper masking tape is used as a pre-engraving overcoat on finished and resiny woods, cleanup is a matter of picking the tape off and out of the blank fringe area, which is easier than removing the sticky and smoky surround "halos" (and requires no varnish-removing chemicals). </p>

					<p><b>Plastics</b>, both cast and extruded acrylic can generally be laser engraved pretty well. Other plastics may be successfully engraved, but orderly experimentation on a sample piece is recommended. Expanded plastics, foams and vinyl generally are candidates for routing rather than laser engraving. </p>

					<p><b>Metals</b>  such as aluminum, brass, copper, steel and stainless steel and <b>Coated metals</b> can be engraved well. Laser engraving metal plates are manufactured with a finely-polished metal, coated with an enamel paint made to be "burned off" allowing a visible marking by the laser. </p>

					<p><b>Glass</b> - when a laser is used to engrave on glass, it fractures the glass surface leaving a tasteful mark that with the right settings yields beautiful visible results.</p>

					<p><b>Granite and Marble</b>&nbsp; can be laser engraved with extremely fine details. The depth of engraving can be customized to specifications. When laser hits the surface, it fractures such materials. Engraved images can be filled with paint for better contrast appearance. </p>
