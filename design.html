					<h3>WHAT ART FILES DO YOU ACCEPT?</h3>

					<h3>Vector Artwork Files</h3>
					<p>The best file format for promotional product items is a vector based file created in professional graphics application such as Adobe Illustrator, FreeHand or Corel Draw.  Vector files allow us to adjust the size of your artwork without risk of distortion or "jaggies."   Vector art is resolution independent and that's a good thing when you are trying to maintain the integrity of your artwork.  Art must be saved in the Postscript Format and contain no Postscript errors, stray points or colors assigned inconsistently to the supplier’s published requirements.</p>
					
					<p>All type that has been set must be converted to outlines (curves). If future changes to the text will be necessary, the original font file must be supplied with the art file for use on the supplier’s specified computer platform (Mac or PC). All design elements in the file must meet the supplier’s published minimums for line thickness. Failure to do so may compromise the final imprint quality. If the vector file contains any linked (placed) raster images, these images must meet the supplier’s minimum requirement for resolution when rendered at 100% actual imprint size and must be submitted with the original vector file.</p>
					
					<p>EPS files also retain specific <em>PANTONE&tm;</em> color information that ensures accurate logo color and reduces the chance that your <em>HUNTER GREEN 3308</em> will turn into <em>LIME GREEN 375</em>.  These files are also typically small in size so they email and transfer quickly and securely. Be aware that saving your raster based jpeg artwork as an .eps file is NOT vector art.</p>

					<h3>Raster Artwork Files</h3>
					<p>Other files that can produce potentially good results include raster based files created in professional graphics applications like Adobe Photoshop, or Gimp.   All Raster elements and art files must be sized to 100% or larger than the actual imprint size. All Raster images must meet or exceed the supplier’s published minimum resolution (pixels-per-inch) when rendered at the actual imprint size. All raster elements must be submitted in the proper color space (RGB or CMYK) as published by the supplier.</p>
					
					<p>The primary challenge with using these applications to create production quality art is they create resolution dependent files that can get jaggy if they are resized from what was originally created. Make sure the files you create are 300dpi at the size you intend the image to print.</p>

					<h3>Page Layout Document</h3>
					<p>Page layout documents must be prepared to render the artwork and all of its elements at 100% of actual imprint size. In addition to submitting the page layout documents, all vector and/or raster files that are referenced by the page layout document must also be included. Include any fonts that were used in the production of the page layout document or use on the supplier’s specified computer platform (Mac or PC).</p>

					<h3>Acrobat (PDF) Files</h3>
					<p>PDF files created from vector files must retain the editing capabilities of the program that was used to create them (e.g. Illustrator or Freehand).</p>
					
					<p>PDF files that contain raster elements must meet the minimum requirements for raster art files as outlined by the supplier. PDF files that contain vector elements must meet the minimum requirements for vector art files as outlined by the supplier. PDF files created from page layout documents should be submitted together with the source documents, fonts and all supporting files.</p>
					
					<h3>Fonts</h3>
					<p>Any fonts used in the production of art files should be converted to curves (outlines) prior to submission. If future typesetting will be required, the original font files must be included with the artwork file to be used on the supplier’s specific computer platform (Mac or PC).</p>

					<p>Some file formats are definitely not appropriate for quality promotional marketing projects.  MS PowerPoint, MS Word and MS Paint really don’t work to create production ready art.  File types ending in .jpg, .gif, .png, .ppt and .doc are not acceptable production ready art either.  While the internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, art appearing on a website really doesn’t work well either for the sake of branding a promotional marketing product.  Even though it may look good on your 1080p screen, it will not look good on your custom imprinted, laser engraved or embroidered promotional marketing item.</p>
					
					<h3>Proofs</h3>
					<p>No matter what the format or transfer method, artwork should NEVER be submitted without either a hard copy proof or the electronic equivalent. Properly prepared PDF files are often suitable as proofs.
